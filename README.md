**Data Science Core Independent Project Week 9**

**Classification of Titanic & Email Datasets**

**Description**


Experimenting using the K-NN and Naive Bayes Classifiers on two different datasets in order to observe their performance. Firstly, the Titanic dataset was used to test the K-NN classifier then Naive Bayes classifier was used on a text vectorized dataset to classify emails as either ham or spam.

**Platforms Used**

Google Colab
Git/GitHub
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas Library
Numpy Library
Matplotlib Library
Seaborn Library
Standard Library
SciPy Library
Sci-Kit Library
Plotly

**Motivation**

The goal was to observe the performance of the two types of classifiers (K-NN & Naive Bayes) after determining the optimum train/test split, hyperparameters and utilizing model performance enhancements(data reduction, scaling, applying smoothing or not, etc).
